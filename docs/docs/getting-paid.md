# Getting paid

## Dealing with banks

In a case where you're ultimately getting paid through your bank, please note that most banks no longer issue a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC). Instead, they issue an eFIRA (electronic Foreign Inward Remittance Advice). The GST machinery, at least as of February 2018, does not consider an eFIRA to be proof of a foreign remittance.

To avoid potentially losing income, ask your branch of interest prior to opening an account with them if they issue an FIRC. Alongside, consult a CA and speak to your local GST office and ask them if they accept an eFIRA.

The best course of action would be get an LUT before issuing any invoice at all. That way, you don't need to submit an FIRC to get 18% of your income back.

## International payments

### SWIFT

The most well understood method of international transfer is SWIFT. Bankers get it, government babus get it, your local CA gets it. If you're registered under GST, take note of [CGST Rule 89(2)(c)](https://www.gst.caclub.in/rule-89-of-cgst-rules-2017-application-for-refund-of-tax-interest-penalty-fees-or-any-other-amount/) and [circular number 37/2018](http://www.cbec.gov.in/resources/htdocs-cbec/gst/circularno-37-cgst.pdf) dated 15.03.2018. You specifically need either a Bank Realisation Certificate or a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate to "prove" your export was legal.

Unfortunately, most banks refuse to issue an FIRC. Transferwise has two excellent resources on understanding this: [What’s a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) and how can I request one?](https://transferwise.com/help/article/2630027/indian-rupee-transfers/whats-a-foreign-inward-remittance-certificate-firc-and-how-can-i-request-one) and [FIRC: A guide to its meaning and procedure](https://transferwise.com/us/blog/firc-meaning-india). To quote for brevity:

> Recently in 2016, the RBI updated regulations as far as what banks will issue FIRCs for. So this may depend on the bank. But, in general the following 2 documents can be issued by “AD (Authorized Dealer) Category I” banks in India as proof of foreign transfers to India:
> * Physical FIRC: Issued only for transfers (inward remittances) covering Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) / Foreign Institutional Investment (FII).
> * e-FIRC: According to the RBI, AD Category I banks must report all money transfers to India to Export and Data Monitoring Systems (EDPMS). This includes any advances or outstanding transfers they've received for the **export of goods or software.** Banks that receive these kinds of transfers will issue an electronic FIRC to EDPMS when the exporter asks them to.

> In all other cases of inward remittances, many banks in India may issue you a foreign inward remittance advice (similar to a certificate of inward remittance). This advice usually contains similar details as an FIRC. Please note, such advices are typically available for businesses only.

The two circulars that banks often quote are both from [FEDAI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fedai.asp): [SPL-04/2016](http://www.fedai.org.in/DocumentUploadFiles/SPL_04_2016_21_APRIL_2016.pdf) and [SPL-09/2016](http://www.fedai.org.in/DocumentUploadFiles/SPL_09_2016_8_JUNE_2016.pdf).

There are [102 member banks](http://www.fedai.org.in/InnerPageContent.aspx?Cid=2&SCid=1&SSCid=0) as of December 2017, which pretty much covers all banks you'd want to use for your business.

What does this mean for you? Exports which are zero-rated end up being taxed in a round-about way.  
The normal rate of IGST (as per your SAC) will be applicable - but remember you cannot collect it from your client! It has to come out of your pocket while at the same time, you are ineligible for a refund. In this way, you actually get taxed and worse, the tax comes from your own revenue - unlike the normal case where you simply collect it from a customer and deposit it with the government.

#### IFS Code (IFSC)

Certain banks might ask for your IFS Code (IFSC) despite it being a SWIFT payment. This is risky as you may receive the money at a poor exchange rate as well as your bank may be unable to issue you an Advice showing receipt of foreign currency and its conversion. This is because in this scenario, the origin bank might convert the funds to INR on their own and send that to your bank account as INR directly.

However, there is also a possibility this is just a regulatory requirement as per the origin bank (this has happened!) and that the SWIFT transfer will proceed normally.

### TransferWise

Some users have claimed TransferWise is fine to accept international payments, and generally accepted by the tax dept. for filing taxes.

Interestingly, TransferWise does not require you as an Indian business to possess an account with them. Check [their help article](https://transferwise.com/help/14/currencies/2932151/inr-transfers) for INR transfers, as on 11/08/2019.

> Email transfers | No | Transfers to an email address are not available for payments to INR.

I would recommend that you go through the whole document very carefully and get in touch with TransferWise if you have any concerns.

However, the remitting party must be registered with TransferWise as a verified business to be able to send you payments.

Your contracted client would ask you for your bank details, as in any regular domestic NEFT/IMPS bank transfer. However, do not make the mistake of receiving business funds in a savings account -- use only a current account.

### Other Routes

Other routes include [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) and Wire Transfers (SWIFT is a type of wire transfer).
