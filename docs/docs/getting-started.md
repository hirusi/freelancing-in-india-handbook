# Getting started

## Constituition of your business

You have several options here, but the two simplest ones to start with are as an individual or as a registered sole proprietorship. If you have a partner, a partnership or an LLP is also worth considering.

Individual and sole proprietorship are **different** things. You need a registration under Shops & Establishment Act, 1932, for the latter. An individual operates completely in their personal capacity - an Aadhaar card and a PAN card is all you really need.

## Registrations

### Goods and Services Tax (GST)

As long as you're earning below ₹20,00,000 per annum, GST registration is optional whether you have foreign clients or just domestic clients.

Once you cross the ₹20,00,000 ceiling, GST registration becomes compulsory.

If you're in any of the north eastern states, this ceiling is ₹10,00,000 per annum.

#### Some Finer Details
