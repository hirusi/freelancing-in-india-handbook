# About The Handbook

## Structure

Every topic has a distinct page, no matter how concise.

## Motivation

The legal framework is a mess. Consulting chartered accountants, banks, and the tax office, all of whom have their own version of the law, is a headache you shouldn't have to deal with when you're just starting out. This is to simplify things for you - give you a simple and comprehensive starting point to begin making sense of things.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Each page has a link at the bottom, titled 'Help us improve this page'.

## Disclaimer

This only corresponds to web development/freelance coding at the moment.

I am not legally liable for anything that you pick up from here and use. Use your discretion. Consult a chartered accountant and/or a lawyer. This is a handbook for legal how-tos, but that does not mean it maintains legal standing or integrity.

Rules change frequently. I may not have kept up. You're free to contribute and help me maintain this based on your experiences.
