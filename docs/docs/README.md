# About The Handbook

## Structure

The handbook was originally limited to web development to foreign clients. I'm working on expanding it to include SaaS offerings, paid apps on app stores, and so on - both domestically and internationally. Use caution. If something seems off or misleading, [please contribute](#contributions).

## Motivation

The legal framework is a mess. Consulting chartered accountants, banks, and the tax office, all of whom have their own version of the law, is a headache you shouldn't have to deal with when you're just starting out. This is to simplify things for you - give you a simple and comprehensive starting point to begin making sense of things.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Each page has a link at the bottom, titled 'Help us improve this page'.

Please link to references wherever possible. If curating information from a bunch of different pages, link to them by creating a 'Resources' heading at the bottom of the page.

## Disclaimer

I am not legally liable for anything that you pick up from here and use. Use your discretion. Consult a chartered accountant and/or a lawyer. This is a handbook for legal how-tos, but that does not mean it maintains legal standing or integrity.

Rules change frequently. I may not have kept up. You're free to [contribute](#contributions) and help me maintain this based on your experiences.
